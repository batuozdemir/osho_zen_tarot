The Flying Bird
This layout is designed in the shape of a bird taking flight.  The cards chosen and placed in the left wing symbolize and indicate to us something about our feminine, receptive energy, while the right wing symbolizes our masculine, active energy.  The first card picked is the initiator of the flight and stems from this active side.  Each succeeding card responds to the previous one and lifts "the bird" higher, allowing the questioner to move into greater clarity and inner understanding.

1- Here & now â€” the 'lift-off" card
2- The resistance card - 'fear of flying' 
3- Response-ability to the fear
4- Inner support (intuition) of responsibility
5- External support (intelligent action responding to the intuition)
6- Relaxation and acceptance
7- Arrival at a new level of awareness
