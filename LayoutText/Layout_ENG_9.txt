The Ankh
The Ankh tarot spread is based the ancient Egyptian ankh sign, a symbol of life also known as the “mirror of Venus”. As the ankh consists of a circle and a cross, the placement of cards affects their meanings. Cards which are placed on the circle of the ankh spread indicate a spiritual background and the root cause of happenings, while cards placed on the cross show how problems are manifested in real life, what can be done to avoid them and what they will bring.
