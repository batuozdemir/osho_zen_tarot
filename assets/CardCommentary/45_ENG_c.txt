How many people do you know who, just when they were completely overloaded, with too many projects, too many "balls in the air", have suddenly come down with the flu, or taken a fall and ended up on crutches? That's just the sort of "bad timing" the little monkey with the pin in his hand is about to impose on the "one-man-band" pictured here! The quality of stress represented by this card visits all of us at times, but perfectionists are particularly vulnerable to it. We create it ourselves, with the idea that without us nothing will happen--especially in the way we want it to! Well, what makes you think you're so special? Do you think the sun won't rise in the morning unless you personally set the alarm? Go for a walk, buy some flowers, and fix yourself a spaghetti dinner--anything 'unimportant' will do. Just put yourself out of that monkey's reach!
