Can tarot cards tell the future? 

"Freedom can exist only if the future is open. But about an open future there is no possibility of prediction. The man who was so beautiful may commit a murder tomorrow. Tomorrow is open. One thing that is very fundamental has to be remembered, and that is that whenever we are doing anything – astrology, future prediction, horoscope readings, palmistry, the I-Ching, Tarot – anything that is concerned with the future, it is basically a reading of the unconscious of the person. It has nothing much to do with the future.

It has more to do with the past, but because the future is created by the past, it is relevant to the future, too. Because people live like mechanical things, the prediction is possible. If you know the past of the person, unless the person is a buddha, you will be able to predict his future because he is going to repeat it. If he has been an angry person in the past, he is carrying the tendency to be angry; that tendency will have effects in the future. Ordinarily, an unconscious being goes on repeating his past again and again.

It is a wheel-like phenomenon, he repeats it; he cannot do anything else. He cannot bring any new thing into his life, he cannot have a breakthrough. That's why all these sciences work. If people are more aware, more alert, they won't work. You cannot read the horoscope of a Buddha, or read his hand, because he is so free of the past and he is so empty in the present that there is nothing to read."
