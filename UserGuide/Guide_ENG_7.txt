About the Author:

Osho's teachings defy categorization, covering everything from the individual quest for meaning to the most urgent social and political issues facing society today. His books are not written but are transcribed from audio and video recordings of extemporaneous talks given to international audiences over a period of thirty-five years. Osho has been described by The Sunday Times in London as one of the "1000 Makers of the Twentieth Century" and by American author Tom Robbins as "the most dangerous man since Jesus Christ." 

About his own work Osho has said that he is helping to create the conditions for the birth of a new kind of human being. He has often characterized this new human being as "Zorba the Buddha" Â– capable both of enjoying the earthy pleasures of a Zorba the Greek and the silent serenity of a Gautam Buddha. Running like a thread through all aspects of Osho's work is a vision that encompasses both the timeless wisdom of the East and the highest potential of Western science and technology. 

Osho is also known for his revolutionary contribution to the science of inner transformation, with an approach to meditation that acknowledges the accelerated pace of contemporary life. His unique "OSHO Active Meditations" are designed to first release the accumulated stresses of body and mind, so it is easier to experience the thought-free and relaxed state of meditation.

About the Illustrator:

Deva Padma (Susan Morgan) is an American-born artist. Through meeting Osho she discovered, she says, that "Creativity is my meditation." For many years Padma lived as part of the community that surrounded Osho, contributing her artistic  talent. The creation of the artwork for this tarot was accomplished over four years with Osho's guidance and the insight and support of many members of the community. Special thanks go to Jivan Upasika who inspired the beginnings of this project, and who shared her extensive understanding of the tarot.
